# Progress-Kingdom
Automated kingdom building idle game using html/javascript

Enjoy the perfect idle game. It does not even make you click pointless buttons to make you feel like you're accomplishing something. Just leave the page up and watch your kingdom grow! Game Currently takes around 3 hours to complete but the debug button is currently open for cheating. This game is a take on the new trend with idle "games". Idle games require the player to check in and colect coins or click on upgrade buttons or other pointless tasks. Why not just drop the pretense at this point and let the game play itself? Progress Kingdom does just that!
