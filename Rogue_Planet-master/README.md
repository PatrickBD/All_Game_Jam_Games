# rogue_planet
A minimal graphic sci-fi pathfinding game made in less than 48 hours for the Ludum Dare 38 Compo

==Description==
A ship crash lands on a small rogue planet far away from any star. The survivors must gather luminescent crystals to cut through the darkness and send out guides to find more before their resources run out. This is a simple graphic sci-fi horror game with resource management and a path-finding AI that tries to map out an area and find new clusters. Made using only html/javascript with canvas. Not much time to play test/balance so their are 3 difficulties, including an unlimited mode for messing around. Some basic base building elements are there but I had to simplify everything for the sake of time. I hope to add things like research, equipment, random events, ect. later. There is a simple win condition by lasting long enough for rescue.

==Notes on the source code==
If you are here that means you are going to look at my source code ( I feel violated >.< ). Keep in mind this was done in a 48 hour compo so some inefficent code, coder debt, and quite a bit of zombie code is in here to try and rush it in for the deadline. Sorry for any confusion. I'm usually cleaner.
