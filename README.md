Here is all the games I made for public game jams, such as Ludum Dares. I collected all the repositories into one

# Mole_of_Moles
A game made for the 72 hour xkcd Game Jam based on the "What If?" article of the same name

This game was made in 72 hours for the xkcd Game Jam in November of 2017. For those who don’t know, the theme was to make a game based off of one of the xkcd webcomics or “What If?” articles. As you might imagine, I chose for my project the “What if?” article “A Mole of Moles”. It’s a short witty piece on what a mole(the unit of measurement) of moles(the small furry critter) might look like.

A Mole of Moles is an idle/clicker game with level mechanics. It can be played either actively or passively in the background (however, like any JS game, it will slow down if not an active tab). Buy upgrades and click on the Mole Hole to produce moles. Click on the Thresh-mole-d button when you have enough moles to level up and raise your Mega Mole-tiplier! Try to get to 6.02 x 10^23 moles! It’s exponential-tastic!

I made this game solo within 72 hours for the xkcd game jam using no game making software or templates. Just me and atom, html, and JavaScript. I made all the assets art and such, except the music which is from DL Sounds.  The game is otherwise ~100% complete and playthrough-able.


# Squirrel_Puncher_4000

A Javascript Canvas post apocalyptic boxing game made in under 48 hours for Ludum Dare 40 Compo. Like all the Ludum Dare Compo games, no premade assets were used. I also only ever use raw code in Atom, no game making software or templates. 

# Cough-Drop-Hamster
A game made using Javascript, HTML, Jquery, and canvas

This game started out as a quick get well soon card for a friend of mine that I kept coming back and adding features to it til it felt like a full game. Originally just a simple snake game mod, The current game has a sort of arcade rouge-like feel with levels, simple animation, powers, 13 characters, and 5 bosses. The game also has an AI character (Robo Hammy)that auto plays through the game. The code is runs fine but still a work in progess. Feel free to sample the game.

# Rogue_Planet
A minimal graphic sci-fi pathfinding game made in less than 48 hours for the Ludum Dare 38 Compo

==Description==
A ship crash lands on a small rogue planet far away from any star. The survivors must gather luminescent crystals to cut through the darkness and send out guides to find more before their resources run out. This is a simple graphic sci-fi horror game with resource management and a path-finding AI that tries to map out an area and find new clusters. Made using only html/javascript with canvas. Not much time to play test/balance so their are 3 difficulties, including an unlimited mode for messing around. Some basic base building elements are there but I had to simplify everything for the sake of time. I hope to add things like research, equipment, random events, ect. later. There is a simple win condition by lasting long enough for rescue.

==Notes on the source code==
If you are here that means you are going to look at my source code ( I feel violated >.< ). Keep in mind this was done in a 48 hour compo so some inefficent code, coder debt, and quite a bit of zombie code is in here to try and rush it in for the deadline. Sorry for any confusion. I'm usually cleaner.
