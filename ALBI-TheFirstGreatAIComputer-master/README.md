# ALBI-TheFirstGreatAIComputer

"ALBI: The First Great AI Computer" is an html/javascript game with original ascii art and word puzzles. It was made in less than 48 hours for the Ludum Dare competition. Working within the time limits, The game is not 100% complete by the dare deadline. This the Ludum Dare version and I'm keeping this as is, so it is only what I coded by the 48 hour deadline. If I finish the game, it will be in a different file. However, There is an ending and it is accessible if you can find it. The art and flavor is pretty well there too.
