# Cough-Drop-Hamster
A game made using Javascript, HTML, Jquery, and canvas

(Note: Work in progress)
This game started out as a quick get well soon card for a friend of mine that I kept coming back and adding features to it til it felt like a full game. Originally just a simple snake game mod, The current game has a sort of arcade rouge-like feel with levels, simple animation, powers, 13 characters, and 5 bosses. The game also has an AI character (Robo Hammy)that auto plays through the game. The code is runs fine but still a work in progess. Feel free to sample the game. When I feel satisfied with the game I will publish in on a game website.
