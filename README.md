# All_Game_Jam_Games
Here is all the games I made for public game jams, such as Ludum Dares

# Squirrel_Puncher_4000

A Javascript Canvas post apocalyptic boxing game made in under 48 hours for Ludum Dare 40 Compo. Like all the Ludum Dare Compo games, no premade assets were used. I also only ever use raw code in Atom, no game making software or templates.
